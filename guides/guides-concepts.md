## Kinematics

1. Vector: a quantity that has both magnitude(amount) and direction. Ex: 35 miles(magnitude) west(direction)
2. Scalar: a quantity that has only magnitude. Ex: 25 mph.
3. Distance vs. Displacement 
    1. Distance (scalar) is how far something moves and it includes the path travelled. Ex: 3 meters
        1. Distance can NOT be negative, no matter where the object goes. This is because distance, being a scalar has no directional value
    2. Displacement (vector) is the straight-line distance from where the object started to where it ended. Ex: 2 Meters 36 degrees
        1. Displacement is the change in position of an object. Δx = xf − xi
        2. Displacement, being a vector, can be negative. Ex: going backwards.


## 2D Kinematics
There isn’t much different about 2D motion. Simply “copy and paste” the equations change the variables and a few rules. But there are many **important** concepts to understand: 
***THE X AND Y DIRECTION ARE SEPARATE (diff. values EXCEPT TIME)***
ax=0, so vx is **constant**.
t is the **same** in both Y and X directions-good variable to solve for
$$ a_y = 10 $$ (downward)

If given initial velocity at an angle(resultant), separate it into its components: 
    
$$ V_x = V*cosθ ; V_y = V*sinθ $$


- Ground-to-ground: path is symmetrical, so at the max height: Vy=0, and t = ½ * the total time.
- Horizontal to ground: $$ V_{oy} = 0 $$
- Elevated ground: path is symetrical until the object goes under initial height
- Note: $$ a_y $$ can be negative or positive, but you MUST BE CONSISTENT, so the sign of Δy should be the same.

### Position(x) Time(t) graph: 
- Slope: $$ \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = v $$
- Area between the equation and the x/time axis: NOTHING (there is nothing before position - $$ x*t=nothing $$)
### Velocity(v) Time(t) graph:
- Slope: $$ \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta x}{\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t}} = acceleration(a) $$
- Area: $$ \Delta v * \Delta t = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} * t = \Delta x = displacement(x) $$
### Average [value] = $$ \frac{\Delta value}{\Delta t} $$
- Ex: average velocity = $$ \frac{x - x_0}{t - t_0} $$
