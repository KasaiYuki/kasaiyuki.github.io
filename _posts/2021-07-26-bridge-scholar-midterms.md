### Midterm Tips and Practice Problems

Hey Scholars!
With the midterm closing in I wanted to share a few helpful resources.
Khan Academy and [FlippingPhysics](https://www.flippingphysics.com/ap-physics-1.html) both have great review videos and the former has some practice.
On top of this, I have scanned a few of my old exams from high school (AP): 
* [1D Kinematics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZJOG9WM78hFHL9KNC4plTRNu3UDrsOTM/view?usp=sharing)
* [2D Kinematics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T8HhfvILlDUuVe_xDYO1NK8fgsaSKdAd/view?usp=sharing)
* [More Kinematics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17D_LrsNtmJmbAGHFacjpEV8N2eNJpHBX/view?usp=sharing)
* [Forces](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pbfc7GAJkBdf2vlYgiwBkW0kN29ZDlR7/view?usp=sharing)

Also feel free to check out the [2D Kinematics strategies  page](/guides/guides-strats/kin-strats) or [Forces strategies page](/guides/guides-strats/forces-strats) for some more general tips, as well as all my [study guides](/guides/guides-topic/) for more detailed help.
